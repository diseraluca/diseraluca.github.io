# Why Integer Partitioning?

The last few months have been pretty stressfull between university, searching for a challenging job ( which is absolutely the most stressfull one ), personal projects and, obviously, the whole COVID-19 situtation.
I thus was looking for a breather, something that would distract myself but that I would be able to take less seriously than a personal project ( which, in the end, will stress me as I fight my unreachable perfection problem ).

I've decided to read [Grune/Jacob's Parsing Techniques](https://dickgrune.com/Books/PTAPG_2nd_Edition/).
Now, in the book, the first parsing method that is encountered is that of [Unger's Parsers](https://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/Parsing/unger.pdf) which requires all the k-partitions of the input string to execute ( which is actually the partitioning of a set, but we can build that from integer partitions ).

> From what I could gather it seems that, in regards to Unger's Parsers, we are actually interested in Integer Compositions rather than partitions. 
> The difference seems to be that order does not matter in partitions, such that $$ 2 + 1 $$ and $$ 1 + 2 $$ represent the same partition, while it matters in compositions.

To my surprise, it seems that there is no default way in factor to partition a sequence in k-partitions; or, at least, I was unable to find it neither by searching where I toughth it would be, namely, [math.combinatorics](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-math.combinatorics.html), [grouping](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-grouping.html) or [splitting](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/vocab-splitting.html); neither by a general search.

Thus, I decided to look a bit into the topic, which is mostly new to me ( I haven't really done much combinatorics and I just know some small bits here and there that I learned when needed ).

# What does it mean to partition an integer?

A partition of a positive integer $$ n $$ is a multiset of positive integers which sum is $$ n $$.
For example, $$ \{\, 6\, 1\, 1\, \} $$ is a partition of $$ 8 $$ since $$ 6 + 1 + 1 = 8 $$.

<table>
  <caption>Partitions for the positive integer 8</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>1-partitions</th>
    <th>2-partitions</th>
    <th>3-partitions</th>
    <th>4-partitions</th>
    <th>5-partitions</th>
    <th>6-partitions</th>
    <th>7-partitions</th>
    <th>8-parttions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>7 + 1</td>
    <td>6 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>5 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 </td>
    <td>2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>6 + 2</td>
    <td>5 + 2 + 1</td>
    <td>4 + 2 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td>2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>5 + 3</td>
    <td>4 + 2 + 2</td>
    <td>3 + 2 + 2 + 1</td>
    <td>2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>4 + 4</td>
    <td>4 + 3 + 1</td>
    <td>2 + 2 + 2 + 2</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>3 + 3 + 2</td>
    <td>3 + 3 + 1 + 1</td>

    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

We call an element of a partition a part. Thus, by $$ k-partition $$ of $$ n $$ we will mean a partition of $$ n $$ that has $$ k $$ parts.

On a really basic level, this seems to be all there is to the definition of Integer Partitions.
> On a more involved level, there seems to be a lot of cool knowledge related to Integer Partitions.
> One such bit that I encountered is the [work](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ramanujan%27s_congruences) done by mathematician [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)( On which, by the way, there is a somewhat engaging [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity_(film)) ) on the partition function.
