This blog is my personal page that I will use to share my studies and experiments or products.
The main content you will find is coding posts related to Maya plugin and code optimizations.
There are two main categories of posts that will be part of this blog:
<!--more-->

#### Case Study

>> A case study a series of posts about a particular project I'm working on and studying.
>> Every case study will be a long running series where I will explain my workings and products.
>> They will contain a good amount of code that will be developed iteratively from a post to another.

#### Experimentation

>> An experimentation is a small, self-contained post about an exercise or small experiment I ran.
>> It will contain some code to test or demonstrate the post experiment and will contain my result about it.

Some other category of posts you can find on this blog are:

### Cool Story, bro

>> Cool Story, bro are posts where I may tell some story or anectode about something I worked on or would like to work on.
>> They usually won't contain code or will contain some snippets. They may contain some data about performance or code-related data.

### Coding tips and trick

>> Small posts where I share a coding tip I just learned or used that I find cool or interesting in someway.


That is all for now. I hope this blog will be able to teach something to someone else and to myself.
