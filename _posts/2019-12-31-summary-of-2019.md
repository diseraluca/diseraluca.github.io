# A year full of change

This year started quite frantically for me.

I resigned from my first developer job on the 7th of January, 2019, as the depressed, machine-like environment was making me lose
my joy and passion for programming while slowing down my learning.

Free from an uninspired workplace, I was able to concentrate full-force on my self-growth again, which brought me, a few months and some refused job offers later, to the job I've been doing all year round.

With this new job came many changes. I had to transfer again, to Sardinia, facing a somewhat new culture and a completely new workplace.
All in all, tough, this was one of my best learning experince up to this date.
