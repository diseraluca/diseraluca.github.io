<p>
The code in this post does not necessarily reflect how I would write production targeted code.
As an experimentation the code written for it is usually wrote with the intention of "Just Making it work" to not waste too much time.
The snippet or code samples you may see here may contain traces of Bad Code, Code Smells, Spaghetti Code, Unoptimized code...
Please bear with me anyway, it hurts me as much as it hurts you.
