title: About Me

<p>
I was always a geek-head. As such I self-formed myself, since I was little, in everything that could get my interest was it a humanistic discipline or a scientific one.
I was especially passionate about programming and computer sciences and I self-studied those discipline for some years.
</p>
<p>
After feeling burned out I left any type of studying and concentrated on other sides of my life, like work and social activities.
Fast forward a few years and I felt the urge to learn and improve my knowledge again. By reading books that I found interesting I stumbled across Owen Dermers's - Digital Texturing and Painting which got me in love with Textures and their working.
I then enrolled in Rainbow's Academy 3d Digital Production course 12th ( October 2017 - July 2018 ) to become a texture artist.

In the end, I discovered and got passionate about rigging while following the course and my Technical side emerged again making me start with my developer studies again.
While following the course I studied, in whatever free time I could find, Maya API's and general Maya programming while trying to develop my rigging skills.
In the end I decided to follow a Developer Career. I got particularly interested in High-performance Computing and Code Optimizations and hope to be able to work in this sector.

As of now I'm unemployed and in search of work.
